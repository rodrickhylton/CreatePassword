## Description
This is an application that is meant to create a password. There isn't much creativity happening with the styling of the application but its nature is meant to do other things. There should be certain prompts that pop up with the click of a button. It should ask the User questions such as: "How many characters do you want?", "Do you want numbers in your password?", etc. There are if statements to predict what is needed for an acceptable criteria for the password.
